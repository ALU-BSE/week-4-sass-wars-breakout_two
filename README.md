## Team Roles (assign one per person)
- **Variable Master**: Manages all variables ($colors, $fonts, $spacing)
- **Mixin Creator**: Builds reusable mixins for common patterns
- **Nesting Architect**: Handles all nested selectors and organization
- **Function Developer**: Creates custom Sass functions for calculations
- **Compiler**: Manages the build process and final CSS output
